# Live demo of NASA Spce Apps hackathon 2023
Given the severity of fires in recent years, including in Italy, we created an application idea to analyze fire data from NASA FIRMS satellites and cross-reference it with citizen reports, so that valuable time can be gained between detection and firefighter intervention. ðŸ”¥ðŸŒŽ

We created a standardized protocol for classification of reports integrated with Google. The algorithm processes the data considering wind speed, direction and land morphology, so is able to notify the population in the area at risk through SMS broadcast technology (same used by IT-alert).
